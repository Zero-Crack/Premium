### Description
**[Premium](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MjIzOTczMjAwMjI0NjA2?story_media_id=3121282198900040692_5398218083)** was made on *30 July 2021* and then I distributed it to the public in November 2021 with version 9.5 which is available on termux and pydroid3. This script becomes paid in 2022 when someone trades this script without my permission. [Premium](https://github.com/RozhakXD/Premium) is the mother of all scripts so all the features will be great here. **Premium** is a script created using the Python programming language which has a function to **Hack Instagram** accounts randomly with an easy list of passwords. This script is highly recommended for beginners because there are various ways to use this script.

This script will not require updates because it is automatically updated at all times. You don't need to worry if a problem occurs because this script will learn how to update next.

## Features

This Program is developed using SSL pinning bypass methods for Instagram and the latest API version, allowing for login via cookies. This approach helps prevent Instagram from detecting and blocking spam. The script offers several features, including the ability to get free Likes, Comments, and Followers, and generates random user agents to keep the account updated and less detectable.

  ### Spam or Logout Issues
  - **Airplane Mode**: Use Airplane Mode on your device before dumping to reduce the risk of detection. Enabling Airplane Mode can help reset your network connection and minimize the chances of your IP being flagged by Instagram.
  - **Desktop Mode**: Open Instagram in desktop mode at [Instagram Web](https://www.instagram.com/) and refresh the page every few minutes. This helps maintain a stable session and can prevent unexpected logouts.
  - **Cookies**: Ensure the cookies you are using are active in the browser where they were obtained. Active cookies help maintain your login session and reduce the chances of being logged out.
  - **Account**: If your current Instagram account is detected as spam, switch to a different account. Using a different account can help you avoid spam detection and continue your activities without interruptions.
  - **System Issues**: Instagram may sometimes experience technical problems that cause unexpected logouts. In such cases, waiting for a while or trying again later might resolve the issue.

  ### Getting Successful Results
  - **User-Agent Selection**: Choose high-quality user-agents such as `REALME`, `OPPO`, `POCO`, `XIAOMI`, `SAMSUNG`, `INFINIX`, `ONEPLUS`, `PIXEL`, `NEXUS`, and `HUAWEI`. Good user-agents mimic real devices, which helps avoid detection by Instagram.
  - **Method Selection**: Use reliable methods such as `Instagram Apps 2024`, `Instagram Apps 2023`, `Threads Apps 2023`, and `Account Center`. These updated methods have a higher success rate and are more effective.
  - **Account Criteria**: Target new accounts or those with fewer followers. These accounts are generally less secure and easier to access, increasing your chances of success.
  - **Luck and Target**: Success is influenced by your luck and the specific account you target. Variability in results can occur based on the target’s activity and security measures.
  - **Automatic Settings**: Opt for the automatic setting labeled `Not Recommended` or option number one. These settings are optimized to improve performance and success rates.
  - **Target Search**: Look for targets on [Instagram Explore](https://www.instagram.com/explore/) with at least 1,000 followers. Accounts with more followers are usually more active and easier to target.

  ### Troubleshooting Results Issues
  - **Execution Issues**: If you aren't getting any results, it could be due to the username you're trying to hack. We find that 90% of issues are caused by the specific username's security measures.
  - **Password Selection**: Use the recommended passwords: `DEFAULT`, `COMPLETE` or numbers `04`, `05`.
  - **Target's Password**: Your target might have a strong or uncommon password.
  - **Password Encryption**: Don't use password encryption as it can reduce your chances of success.
  - **Airplane Mode**: Turn on `Airplane Mode` after every 200 attempts with your username.
  - **WiFi Usage**: If you are not getting any results at all, make sure you are not using a WiFi network, as it can cause your IP to be blocked.

  ### [How to Open Checkpoint Results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11RAN1jMdRK5mCTv8CdUbbGwKet5gnfGh/view?usp=sharing)
  - **User-Agent Selection**: Choose the user-agent from the selection or use the previously used one. This ensures compatibility with the system you are targeting.
  - **Account Status**: This method only works for accounts that are currently online and where the owner has confirmed `Yes, it's me!` This confirmation is necessary to proceed with the process.
  - **Waiting Period**: After cracking, wait for about 1-7 days or up to 30 days before attempting to open the checkpoint results. This waiting period helps in ensuring that the process is effective.
  - **Running the Script**: Execute the script and select option one or `Crack Ulang Hasil Checkpoint` to start the process of reopening the checkpoint results.
  - **File Name**: Enter the name of the file you want to crack from the `Temporary` directory. Ensure you know the exact file name to proceed with the cracking process.

  ### WiFi Network Challenges
  - **IP Blocking**: WiFi connections are more likely to result in your IP address being blocked or flagged by Instagram. This is due to the fixed IP addresses commonly associated with WiFi networks.
  - **Cracking Issues**: WiFi can cause abnormal behavior during the cracking process, such as getting stuck on the `HIDUPKAN MODE PESAWAT 2 DETIK` step. This issue arises because WiFi can create inconsistent connections, affecting the script's efficiency.
  - **Impact on Results**: Using a WiFi network may lead to unsuccessful results or issues with checkpoints. WiFi networks can cause interference that affects the script's performance.

  ### Why Am I Only Getting Checkpoints?
  - **User Agent and Method Selection**: Choosing incorrect user agents or methods can lead to checkpoint results. Ensure that you are selecting the correct user agents and methods for the best chance of success.
  - **Instagram Security Updates**: Instagram's security measures are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to achieve successful results. Frequent updates to Instagram's security can lead to more checkpoint results.
  - **Target Quality**: The target you are trying to crack may not be suitable, or it might have already been attempted by someone else. Ensure that the target is valid and not already processed.
  - **Provider and Compatibility**: Your network provider or the chosen user agent may not be compatible with the method you are using. Try switching providers or user agents if you encounter issues.
  - **IP Address Variation**: Different IP addresses can affect the success rate, as each user has a unique IP. This variation can contribute to frequent checkpoint results.
  - **Previous Success vs. Current Checkpoints**: If you previously achieved successful results but are now only getting checkpoints, it may be due to system bugs on Instagram that have since been resolved, making successful results more challenging.

  ### [Success Results Can't Be Logged In](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10kp-862cR3HOuvWRqGx--ZM-Wg-0IG4d/view?usp=drive_link)
  - **Avoid Browser Login**: Do not attempt to log in using a browser, as this can introduce bugs or issues with your account. Use the recommended methods for logging in to prevent problems.
  - **Device Spam**: If you can't log in, it could be because your device is flagged as spam. Ensure that your device is not compromised or flagged by Instagram.
  - **Update Application**: Log in using the latest version of the Instagram app or a trusted Instagram clone app. This ensures compatibility and reduces the chance of login issues.
  - **Enable Airplane Mode**: Before attempting to log in, make sure to enable Airplane Mode on your device. This can help avoid detection and improve the chances of successful login.
  - **Use Cookies**: You can log in using cookies saved in the Results folder. Ensure you use the correct cookies corresponding to each date to successfully access the account.

  ### Encountering Issues with Success Results?
  - **Successful Results Showing Checkpoint**
    - **Using Cookies**: If you have cookies available, try logging in using those cookies through a browser to bypass checkpoint issues.
    - **Device Mismatch**: Often, this issue occurs due to using a different device from the one previously used, which can trigger Instagram's security measures and lock the account.
  - **Mismatched Followers Count**
    - **Username Overlap**: Sometimes, the same username may appear on two different accounts, leading to discrepancies in follower counts.
    - **Multiple Accounts**: You might receive information about multiple accounts simultaneously, which can cause confusion in follower data.
  - **Cookies Logged Out**
    - **Password Change**: The account owner may have changed the password, which can log out the cookies and prevent access.
    - **Instagram Issues**: There may be problems with Instagram that cause cookies to expire or be logged out unexpectedly.
  - **Unable to Log In to Instagram Account**
    - **High Security**: Instagram's high security might prevent logins from new devices. Ensure you're using a trusted and recognized device.
    - **Blocked Device or IP**: Your device or IP address might be blocked by Instagram, which can prevent successful logins.

  ### Common Issues When Cracking
  - **TERJADI KESALAHAN TAK TERDUGA!**: Similar to the previous message, this unexpected error is a routine part of the process and does not indicate a problem. It’s a sign that the script is functioning as expected.
  - **OOPS, AN ERROR OCCURRED!**: This message indicates that the process is running smoothly despite the error. You can ignore this message as it's a normal part of the operation.
  - **HIDUPKAN MODE PESAWAT 2 DETIK! (RED COLOR)**: You don't need to activate Airplane Mode in this case. The red color simply means that your IP address is not blocked, and this message can be safely ignored.
  - **HIDUPKAN MODE PESAWAT 2 DETIK! (YELLOW COLOR)**: When you see this yellow alert, you are required to enable Airplane Mode within the specified time frame. This helps to avoid detection and improve results.
  - **HIDUPKAN MODE PESAWAT 2 DETIK! (BLUE COLOR)**: The blue message suggests turning on Airplane Mode if no results have been obtained yet. If you have already achieved results, you can disregard this message. It indicates a temporary issue that Instagram is experiencing.
  - **COOKIES DISABLED IN YOUR BROWSER!**: This message signifies that cookies are not functioning properly in your browser. This issue is specific to Instagram and indicates that cookies are not being recognized.
  - **LSD TOKEN NOT FOUND**: This issue does not affect the results you obtain. There’s no need to worry about it, as it will not impact the outcome of the script.
  - **HARAP TUNGGU BEBERAPA MENIT!**: This is a reminder to wait a few minutes. It’s not an error but an indication that your IP address might have been flagged or spammed, and waiting can help resolve the issue.

  ### Troubleshooting Dump Failures
  - **Spam or Blocked Account**: Your Instagram account might have been flagged for spam or temporarily blocked for 24 hours. This can prevent successful dumping.
  - **Logged Out Cookies**: If your Instagram account or the cookies you use are logged out, you will need to update them with new ones. Ensure you have valid and active cookies for the process.
  - **Target or Cookie Issues**: Dump errors are often due to problems with the target account or the cookies you’re using. Verify that both are correct and functioning properly.
  - **Incorrect or Private Target**: The target account you entered may be incorrect, private, or verified with a blue tick. Make sure the target is accurate and accessible.
